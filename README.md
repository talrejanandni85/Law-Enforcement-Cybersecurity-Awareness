# Law Enforcement Cybersecurity Awareness Project üîíüöì

**Overview**  
This project investigates the relationship between cybersecurity training and law enforcement officers' (LEOs) understanding of vehicle-related cyber threats. Conducted in the **Human Performance Lab** at UMass Amherst, this study used a mixed-methods design combining surveys, driving simulation, training interventions, and interviews. Participants were split into two groups ‚Äî one receiving tailored training (Experimental) and the other a general presentation (Sham) ‚Äî to evaluate how training impacts cybersecurity awareness and concern.

## üéØ Project Goal

> To assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity training in improving LEOs' awareness and understanding of vehicle-related cyber threats.

Participants underwent:
1. A baseline introduction and simulated driving task
2. A training intervention (experimental vs. sham)
3. A cybersecurity-focused survey and interview

## üîç Research Question & Hypothesis

**Research Question:**  
How do training and demographic factors (e.g., age, experience, education) affect LEOs‚Äô cybersecurity awareness?

**Hypotheses:**
- Tailored cybersecurity training significantly improves understanding of vehicle cybersecurity risks.
- Demographic factors such as age, experience, and time spent in patrol vehicles interact with training to influence cybersecurity perception.
- The Experimental group will demonstrate stronger cybersecurity awareness than the Sham group.

---

## üìà Summary of Results

- The Experimental group expressed **higher concern** over cyber threats than the Sham group.
- Positive correlation observed between **cybercrime training**, **experience**, and **awareness of cyber threats**.
- Regression analysis suggested group assignment (Experimental vs Sham) had an effect, but findings weren‚Äôt statistically significant due to small sample size.
- Results point to the **need for broader, standardized training** programs within law enforcement agencies.
